        Hi, Kornelijus,<br/>
        Hope you're doing well!<br/>

        I'm available to start working from this week. <br/>
        But now, my Upwork account got unexpectedly blocked, and I'm currently in touch with their support team to sort it out. It might take a bit of time to get it back.<br/>

        In the meantime, I suggest we continue working outside of Upworkâ€”maybe through Telegram (@dreamer2575) or Slack if that works better for project management.<br/>

        Let me know what you think.<br/>

        Best,<br/>
        Anton<br/>
